Assuming you're reading this in a running demo-featset-1 container, you already 
have Informix IDS installed here, in /opt/ibm/informix. This is your "Informix
Directory", and in order to use the product you'll need to set INFORMIXDIR
to that directory, as in:

export INFORMIXDIR=/opt/ibm/informix

Now add $INFORMIXDIR/bin to your path:

export PATH=$INFORMIXDIR/bin:$PATH

Another critical parameter, ONCONFIG, points to your configuration file. That 
file must always be located under $INFORMIXDIR/etc, so a relative path is used.
For example:

export ONCONFIG=onconfig.fs1

There are hundreds of configuration parameters you *can* put in that file, but 
for now just put these lines in $INFORMIXDIR/etc/$ONCONFIG:

ROOTPATH   /opt/ibm/localdata/rootchunk
DBSERVERNAME fs1
MSGPATH    /opt/ibm/localdata/online.log

Now create your root path with the correct ownerships and permissions:

touch /opt/ibm/localdata/rootchunk
chown informix:informix /opt/ibm/localdata/rootchunk
chmod 660 /opt/ibm/localdata/rootchunk

In order for clients and utilities to connect to your server they need to know 
its name, so set the INFORMIXSERVER environment variable like so:

export INFORMIXSERVER=fs1

There's just one more step. You need to create an "sqlhosts" file and add a
line to it. By default the server will look for an $INFORMIXDIR/etc/sqlhosts
file, so let's take advantage of that simplicity and put the following line
in that file:

fs1  onipcshm  demo_featset_1  foo1


In order to 
. ./env.sh
